## How To Play
---
* Begin the game by pressing any key
* Choose a letter A-Z to begin guessing the puzzle word
  * Incorrect guesses will cost a *Miss* and deduct from your total
  * All chosen letters will appear in the **Letters Picked** section
* If you are running low on *Misses* and need a hint, click the **Give Me a Hint!** button
  * You have 3 hints per game (not per puzzle!)
  * Hints increase in specificity with each use
* Try to solve as many puzzles as you can before you run out of *Misses*!
